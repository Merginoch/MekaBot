{"thuglife":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzPNY7lZGD4","rude":" What the fuck did you just fucking say about mechs, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in MEKA, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on the omnics, and I have over 300 confirmed ults. I am trained in booster warfare and I’m the top tank in the entire game. You are nothing to me but just another elimination (+100 🔥). I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this map, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying \"DIE, DIE, DIE!!!\" to my team? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of mech pilots across South Korea and no one can hide from Widowmaker's sight so you better prepare for the ultimate, maggot. The ultimate that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your team. You’re fucking dead, Reaper. I can boost anywhere, anytime, and I can eliminate you over seven hundred times, and that’s just with my shitty fusion cannons. Not only am I extensively trained in out-of-mech combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of MEKA and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable team off the face of the continent, you little feeder. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little \"clever\" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn noob. I will shit explosions all over you and you will drown in them. Nerf this, kiddo.","snip":"( ＾◡＾)っ✂╰⋃╯","chop":"( ＾◡＾)っ🗡 ╰⋃╯","bu":"Bless you!","cls":"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","garbage":"<@208472488315715584>","yo":"whatup","voiceLine":"HI!","!voiceLine":"Loop","nT":"http://konachan.net/sample/8ada1f8c5f62a062e111456e3f89f4d3/Konachan.com%20-%20223383%20sample.jpg"}
